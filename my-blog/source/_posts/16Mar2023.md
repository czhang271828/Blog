Q: Show that group with order $350$ is solvable. 

***

A: The following lemmas are well-known:

* any subgroup with index $2$ is normal; 
* a group $G$ is solvable whenever there exists $H\lhd G$ such that both $H$ and $G/H$ are solvable. 

The solvability of group with order $175=5^2\cdot 7$ is also proved by some basic calculations. Since the number of Sylow $7$-group is $7k+1$, which is also a divisor of $25$, such group has a normal subgroup with order $7$ (aka. unique maximal Sylow $7$-group). The proof is complete.
