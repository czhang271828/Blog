Q: Show that $\Bbb Z$ with the 2-adic metric is not connected.

A: 

Step 1. $\{d_p(x,y)\mid x,y\in \mathbb Q_p\}$ is discrete in $(\varepsilon,\infty)$ for each $\varepsilon >0$. Hence each open ball in $\mathbb Q_p$ is also closed.  

Step 2. $\mathbb Z_p$ is open/closed ball in $\mathbb Q_p$. Therefore $(\mathbb Z_p,\|\cdot \|_p)$ is a topological subspace of $(\mathbb Q_p,\|\cdot \|_p)$.  

Step 3. $\mathbb Q_p$ is totally disconnected. For each distinct $a,b\in \mathbb Q_p$, there exists an open/closed ball $B$ s. t. $a\in B$ and $b\notin B$. As a result, $\mathbb Q_p=B\dot\cup B^c$ is a disjoint union of two open sets.  We deduce that $\mathbb Q_p$ is totally disconnected, so is $\mathbb Z_p$.

Q: Thanks for your reply. Please have a look at my work (for $p=2$):
$$
\begin{array}l
B(0,1)=\{y:d_2(0,y)<1\}=\{y:2|y\},\\
B(1,1)=\{y:d_2(1,y)<1\}=\{y:2|y-1\}.
\end{array}
$$
$B(0,1),B(1,1)$ are disjoint open sets and $\Bbb Z=B(0,1)âˆªB(1,1)$. So $\Bbb Z$ is not connected with the 2-adic metric.

Is the proof correct?

Exactly correct. Your solution can be easily generalised to $\mathbb Z_p$ topology.

From my point of view, there is no need to explore more on $p$-adic numbers until you show some interests in field theory, especially the theory of Krull valuation.

It is highly recommended to learn something about Monsky's thm, a perfect combination of Sperner's lemma and $p$ -adic theory, which is mainly about *the impossibility of dissecting the square into an odd number
of triangles of equal area*. You can enjoy
